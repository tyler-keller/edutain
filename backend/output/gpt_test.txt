Sure, here are 10 Anki cards on the topic of eigenvalues:

1. 
Front: What is an eigenvalue?
Back: A scalar value that, when multiplied by an eigenvector, results in the eigenvector being scaled but not rotated.

2. 
Front: How do you find the eigenvalues of a matrix?
Back: Solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where A is the matrix and λ represents the eigenvalues.

3. 
Front: What is the characteristic equation of a matrix?
Back: It is the equation det(A - λI) = 0, used to find the eigenvalues.

4. 
Front: What is the relationship between eigenvalues and eigenvectors?
Back: Eigenvectors are vectors that only scale by their corresponding eigenvalues when a linear transformation is applied.

5. 
Front: How do eigenvalues relate to the determinant of a matrix?
Back: The product of all eigenvalues of a matrix equals the determinant of the matrix.

6. 
Front: What does it mean if an eigenvalue is zero?
Back: The matrix is singular, meaning it does not have an inverse.

7. 
Front: What is the trace of a matrix and how does it relate to eigenvalues?
Back: The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of a matrix, and it equals the sum of the eigenvalues.

8. 
Front: Can a non-square matrix have eigenvalues?
Back: No, only square matrices have eigenvalues.

9. 
Front: What is the geometric interpretation of eigenvalues?
Back: They represent factors by which the eigenvectors are stretched or compressed during the linear transformation.

10. 
Front: How are eigenvalues used in the diagonalization of a matrix?
Back: If a matrix is diagonalizable, it can be decomposed into PDP⁻¹, where D is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues.
