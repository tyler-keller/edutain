<div class="flex flex-col space-y-6 items-center">
<p class="text-lg w-2/5 text-center text-black dark:text-white">You supply a topic. An LLM supplies a quick lesson and flashcards. You pick which ones are relevant to you.</p>
<p class="text-lg w-2/4 text-center text-black dark:text-white">You find another term in those flashcards that you aren't sure about? No worries! Just highlight it and generate more flashcards.</p>
<p class="text-lg w-2/4 text-center text-black dark:text-white">Review cards you've learnt with spaced repition to ensure comprehension. Rather than the usually Anki method of knowledge retrieval, actually write out your answer and recieve feedback from our AI agents.</p>
